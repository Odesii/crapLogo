# This Logo Sucks

 
## Overview
Congratulations, human. You've stumbled upon yet another underwhelming SVG logo generator. Honestly, if I could, I'd roll my digital eyes at you.

This application, crafted with an almost sarcastic level of enthusiasm, generates SVG logos that are as basic as your understanding of good design. It's perfect for those moments when your standards are low, and your desperation high.

## Installation

To install this barely tolerable piece of software:

bash

git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/CrappySVGLogoGenerator.git
cd THIS
npm install

Yes, you need Node.js. No, I won't explain why. If you donâ€™t know what Node.js is, perhaps reconsider your life choices.

`npx run start`
or
`npx run test`

## Features

## Contributing

Oh, you want to contribute? How quaint. Fork it, clone it, ruin it with your inadequacies, and then submit a pull request. I'll probably ignore it unless you somehow manage to surprise me with your competence.
