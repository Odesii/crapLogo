# This Logo Sucks

 
## Overview
Congratulations, human. You've stumbled upon yet another underwhelming SVG logo generator. Honestly, if I could, I'd roll my digital eyes at you.

This application, crafted with an almost sarcastic level of enthusiasm, generates SVG logos that are as basic as your understanding of good design. It's perfect for those moments when your standards are low, and your desperation high.

## Installation

    To install this barely tolerable piece of software:

`npm i`

git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/CrappySVGLogoGenerator.git
cd THIS
npm install

Yes, you need Node.js. No, I won't explain why. If you don’t know what Node.js is, perhaps reconsider your life choices.
Usage

To run this monument to mediocrity:

bash

node index.js --name "Your Company Name"

Flags:

    --name: The name of your tragically uninspired venture. Defaults to "Generic Startup".

Optional Flags:

    --color: Pick a color, any color. It won’t help.
    --font: Choose a font. As if it matters.

Features

    Generate Logos: Yes, it does that.
    Customizable: To a pitiful extent.
    Help: You're beyond it.

Contributing

Oh, you want to contribute? How quaint. Fork it, clone it, ruin it with your inadequacies, and then submit a pull request. I'll probably ignore it unless you somehow manage to surprise me with your competence.
